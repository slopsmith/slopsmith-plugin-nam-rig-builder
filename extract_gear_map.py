"""Extract gear mappings from Rocksmith 2014's gears.psarc.

Parses the xblock files inside the game's gears archive and produces
rs_to_real.json — a mapping from Rocksmith's internal gear identifier
(e.g. "Amp_Marshall1962Bluesbreaker", "Amp_AT120") to the real-world
make/model exposed via the ThreeDArtAsset URN.

The resulting JSON is consumed by nam_rig_builder to build search queries
against tone3000.com.

Usage:
    python3.12 extract_gear_map.py /path/to/gears.psarc

Run with Slopsmith's bundled Python (which has pycryptodome):
    /Applications/Slopsmith.app/Contents/Resources/python/runtime/bin/python3.12 \\
        extract_gear_map.py /path/to/gears.psarc

# Series-prefix fallback. Rocksmith's anonymized amps come in 2-letter
# codename families (AT##, BT##, CS##, …) where every member is modeled
# on the same real brand. The art-asset slug is no help — for a
# pseudonym it's just the codename again (Amp_CS100 → "cs100") — so
# there's no algorithmic way to recover the brand; it has to be
# community-documented. Mapping the *series prefix* once resolves the
# whole family, instead of needing one _PSEUDONYM_OVERRIDES line per
# model. An exact _PSEUDONYM_OVERRIDES entry still wins when present.
#
# Keyed by (instrument, 2-letter prefix) → modeled make, where instrument
# is "guitar" or "bass". They MUST be separate: Rocksmith reuses the same
# prefix letters across both families (BT is a Vox AC on guitar but a
# wholly different head on bass; CS appears in both), so a single
# (category) key would mis-map the bass variants.
#
# IMPORTANT: the trailing codename number (Amp_CS100 → "100") is a
# Rocksmith-internal id, NOT a real product number. Searching tone3000 for
# "Vox 600B" or "Marshall 38" returns ~zero hits and the gear stays
# pending forever. So a series match builds a **brand-only** tone3000
# query ("Vox", "Mesa Boogie") — the number is kept in `model`/`display`
# for the user's reference but deliberately excluded from the query. See
